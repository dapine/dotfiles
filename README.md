# dotfiles

these are my current config files. i used to rice a lot back years ago, but now i got a life.
if you want to check out my old riced dotfiles, refer to the [archive](https://github.com/dapine/dotfiles/tree/archive) branch.

i also have a separate repository for my nvim editor custom configs [here](https://github.com/dapine/nvim).
